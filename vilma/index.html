        <h2>Obituary</h2>
        <p>
            Vilma Joyce Usher was born on July 23rd 1956 at Belize City Hospital and passed on December 13th 2020. She was born to Alvin Usher and Mavis Fortune Usher. Vilma left Belize City in 1986 and came to America to have a better life for her and her children. She worked as a receptionist at the hospital and when she came to America she furthered her career as a registered nurse. Not long ago she bought a house and was enjoying fixing it to her satisfaction and taste.

            Vilma had much affection for her loved ones but it is no secret that she had special affection for her grandson Jamie with whom she would call anytime to do whatever she needed done whether it was help fixing her car going to the doctor fixing her house or simply just shopping. She is also survived by a host of nieces and nephews and a multiple of other loving relatives and close friends that time will not allow me to mention.
